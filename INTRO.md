## <a name="what"></a>What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?

Search Engine Optimization is the process of positioning a website or URL as high on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) as possible for a particular keyword. As an example, you might want to have a [Japanese Knife Making Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qABAEcmPvyg) show up at the top of Google's SERP for the keyword "Knife Making of Japan". Using SEO, you will use on-site and off-site techniques to rank that video for the associated keyword or keywords.
