## <a name="what"></a>What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?

Search Engine Optimization is the process of positioning a website or URL as high on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) as possible for a particular keyword. As an example, you might want to have a [Japanese Knife Making Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qABAEcmPvyg) show up at the top of Google's SERP for the keyword "knife making japan". Using SEO, you will use on-site and off-site techniques to rank that video for the associated keyword or keywords.

## <a name="everyone"></a>Who benefits from SEO?

All URLs and websites can benefit from SEO. If you are selling a product, providing information (like this article) or want to promote something, SEO can be used to help with that. Mom and pop shops to fortune 500 companies all need SEO in some form. While this seems like an insurmountable task, it is possible for local results to be the huge national companies on the first page of SERPs. Google in particular is a RELEVANCY based algorithm. The best experience from a search engine is to serve up the most relevant content per search. Google takes into account your past search history and websites visited, your geographic location, your IP Address and ISP all to generate the most accurate results for your tailored search.
